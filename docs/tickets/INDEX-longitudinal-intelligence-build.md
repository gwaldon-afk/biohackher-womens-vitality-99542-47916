# Index — Longitudinal Intelligence Build

## Executive Summary

This build plan turns the longitudinal intelligence design into a safe, rules-first delivery path that consolidates protocols deterministically, preserves provenance, and prepares for AI later without relying on it today.

## Rules-First, AI-Later

All logic must be deterministic and explainable. AI can be added later as an optional input, but the rules-first consolidation remains the source of truth.

## Scope Exclusions (Do Not Build)

- Diagnostic labels or medical claims
- AI-generated clinical advice or treatment
- Raw score dashboards without interpretation
- Over-medicalised reports
- Wearables or biometrics inference not collected
- Over-personalization beyond evidence
- Automated clinical alerts
- Social sharing of health outputs
- High-frequency “insight” notifications
- Full clinical record export

## Definition of Done

- Protocols consolidate deterministically with provenance preserved.
- Users can view assessment-scoped protocols without leakage.
- Only active protocols feed plans.
- Export format is clinician-ready and non-diagnostic.
