# Scope Exclusions (Do Not Build)

This list protects user trust, clinical credibility, product focus, and regulatory safety. Each item is explicitly excluded with rationale.

## 1) Diagnostic Labels or Medical Claims

**Do not build:** Any output that diagnoses conditions, labels disease risk, or implies clinical certainty.  
**Why:** BiohackHer is supportive and non-clinical; diagnostic claims create regulatory and trust risk.

## 2) AI-Generated Clinical Advice

**Do not build:** AI-generated clinical advice, medication changes, or treatment plans.  
**Why:** AI is non-deterministic and not clinically validated; unsafe for users and clinicians.

## 3) Raw Score Dashboards

**Do not build:** Score-heavy dashboards without interpretation.  
**Why:** Clinicians want meaning, not raw metrics; scores without context can mislead.

## 4) Over-Medicalised Reports

**Do not build:** Reports using diagnostic language or clinical coding.  
**Why:** The product’s tone is supportive and empowering; this would conflict with positioning.

## 5) Wearables or Biometrics Inference

**Do not build:** Inference of biomarkers or physiological metrics not collected.  
**Why:** Data is not present; inference would be speculative and untrustworthy.

## 6) Over-Personalization Beyond Evidence

**Do not build:** Suggestions that claim “optimal” outcomes without evidence.  
**Why:** Undermines credibility and increases risk of user harm.

## 7) Automated Clinical Alerts

**Do not build:** Alerts or warnings that instruct clinical action.  
**Why:** Requires clinical validation and monitoring pathways not in scope.

## 8) Social Sharing of Health Outputs

**Do not build:** Shareable health insights designed for public/social channels.  
**Why:** Privacy risk and encourages misinterpretation of sensitive health data.

## 9) High-Frequency “Insight” Notifications

**Do not build:** Frequent push notifications claiming insights from minimal data.  
**Why:** Creates noise, erodes trust, and feels manipulative.

## 10) Full Clinical Record Export

**Do not build:** Export of full raw data or full clinical record format.  
**Why:** Not needed for the product’s purpose; increases compliance risk.
