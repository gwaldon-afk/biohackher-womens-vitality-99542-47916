# Clinical Export Format (Printable / PDF-Friendly)

This design outlines a clinician-facing export that is concise, plain-language, and useful for time-poor practitioners. It avoids raw scores without interpretation and provides clear time context.

## Audience

- GP, specialist, or allied health professional
- Not a BiohackHer user
- Wants clinical signal over product detail

## Format Principles

- Single document (PDF-ready)
- Plain language, non-marketing
- No raw scores without interpretation
- Clear time windows for all data
- No diagnostic claims

## Sections and Headings

1) **Patient Context (Non-Identifying)**
   - Age range (e.g., 40–44)
   - Relevant context tags (e.g., “perimenopause”, “high stress” if user self-selected)
   - Time window of report (e.g., “Data from last 90 days”)

2) **Assessment Summary**
   - What assessments were completed
   - Date of most recent completion per assessment
   - Purpose in plain language (e.g., “Hormone Compass: symptom-based staging”)

3) **Key Findings (Patterns)**
   - 3–5 bullet points describing trends or patterns
   - Example: “Sleep quality consistently low in the last 30 days”
   - Avoid raw scores; use interpreted categories (low / moderate / high)

4) **Active Protocols**
   - Protocol name + source assessment
   - Plain-language description of actions
   - Frequency and timing (if known)

5) **Adherence Signals**
   - Simple summary of completion behavior (e.g., “Completed 12/30 planned items in last 14 days”)
   - Daily check-in adherence (e.g., “Check-in completed on 9 of 14 days”)

6) **Red Flags / Considerations (Non-Diagnostic)**
   - “These are self-reported signals, not diagnoses”
   - Example: “Persistent low energy reported for 3+ weeks”

7) **Disclaimers**
   - “This report is informational and not diagnostic.”
   - “All data is self-reported and intended to support care conversations.”
